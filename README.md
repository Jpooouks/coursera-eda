# Coursera Data Analysis Project
## About the Data Set
This data was collected as an exercise at a hackathon and uploaded to Kaggle. The data was scraped from the official Coursera website.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore data for potentially interesting phenomena and to provide business relevant insights or to find further areas of exploration.
## Conclusion
Given this data was scraped as an exercise in a hackaton it is quite unreliable. There are very few observations and few features to come up with meaningful insights. However one pattern that came up constantly during this analysis was the weight that certain educational institutions like prominent American Universities or biggest tech companies had on the popularity outcome. Understanding which kinds of institutions are most trusted by MOOC consumers would provide imense business value.
